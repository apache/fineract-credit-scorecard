# Credit Scorecard Plugin for Apache Fineract

This is a [_Plugin_ for Apache Fineract](https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/fineract-doc/src/docs/en/deployment.adoc). 
(This work is inspired by the design approach of the [fineract-pentaho plugin](https://github.com/openMF/fineract-pentaho).)

see [TODO](TODO.md) for possible future follow-up enhancement work. The TODO list was inherited from [fineract-pentaho plugin]((https://github.com/openMF/fineract-pentaho))


## Build & Use

This project is currently only tested against the `scorecard` branch of Fineract.  Building and using it against older versions may be possible, but is not tested or documented here.

    git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git
    git fetch origin && git checkout credit-scorecard
    cd fineract && ./gradlew bootJar && cd ..

    git clone https://github.com/apache/fineract-credit-scorecard.git
    cd fineract-credit-scorecard && ./gradlew -x test distZip && cd ..

    ./fineract-credit-scorecard/scorecard-plugin/run

The [`run`](run) script basically just creates the following directory structure:

    fineract-provider.jar
    lib/scorecard-plugin.jar
    lib/lib*.jar

and then launches Apache Fineract with the Scorecard Plugin and all its JARs like this:

    java -Dloader.path=lib/ -jar fineract-provider.jar
